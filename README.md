This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's undegraduate essay in Philosophy of Physics, anwering the question "How satisfactory is the de Broglie-Bohm theory as a resoltion to the measurement problem?".

Key points include:
- **Resolution:** Bohmian mechanics avoids wave function collapse by maintaining deterministic evolution under the Schrödinger equation.  
- **Strengths:** Provides clear particle trajectories, matches experimental predictions, and offers an intuitive picture of quantum phenomena.  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Difficulty reconciling with relativity.  
  - Explicit non-locality and contextuality.  
  - Apparent violation of the **action-reaction principle**, raising questions about the ontology of the wave function.  

The essay concludes that while Bohmian mechanics elegantly addresses the measurement problem, its unclear treatment of the wave function prevents it from being a fully satisfactory resolution.

Mark: 68/100.
Feedback: Clear, well-written essay with convincing arguments and good understanding of subject matter. Could be improved by deeper engagement with relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.
